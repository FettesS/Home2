		<h2> System Unit </h2> 
		<img src = "OriginalCase.jpg" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the system unit untouched" />
		<p> This is what the case of the system unit looked like before the group started to dissassemble it. </p>
		<h2 id = "CPU"> Central processing unit (CPU) </h2> 
		<img src = "CPU.JPG" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the Central Processing Unit (CPU)"/> 
		<p> This is the central processing unit (CPU). The CPU gives instructions to the other parts
		of the computer. The CPU&apos;s job is to carry out commands. The CPU can also perform arithmetic operations. </p> 
		<h2 id = "Motherboard"> Motherboard </h2> 
		<img src = "Motherboard.JPG" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the motherboard." /> 
		<p> The motherboard is the main circuit board inside a computer. It is a thin square plate that holds many parts
		including the CPU, memory cards, expansion slots, power connectors, connections and microchips used to power your PC.  
		It also uses expansion cards to control video and audio. The motherboard essentially
		connects all the parts of the computer indirectly and directly. This is its purpose.  </p> 
		<h2 id = "Fan"> Fan </h2> 
		<img src = "Fan.JPG" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the fan" /> 
		<p> The fan helps to keep the computer cool. This prevents the parts of the computer from overheating. 
		It does this by allowing cool air to come into the system unit, while pushing out hot air from 
		the system unit. </p> 
		<h2 id = "PowerSupply"> Power Supply </h2> 
		<img src = "PowerSupply.JPG" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the power supply" />
		<p> The power supply converts the power from the source of energy to the type of power needed by the computer. 
		It sends this power through connecting cables to the motherboard and other components.The power supply is
		where the energy for the entire computer comes from. It also regulates the amount of voltage going into the
	        computer. This ensures that the computer does not get overloaded with electricity. </p> 
		<h2 id = "RAM"> Random Access Memory (RAM) </h2> 
		<img src = "RAM.JPG" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the RAM" /> 
		<p> RAM stands for Random Access Memory. The RAM is your system short term memory as it only provides a 
		temporary storage of information. It is located on the motherboard. The RAM is an example of secondary storage. 
		The more Random Access Memory you have, the more things your computer can do at the same time.
		It disappears when you shut off your computer. When working on your document, spreadsheet, powerpoint, etc, you need to
		save it to avoid losing it. When you save it, the RAM connects with your hard drive so it can save your work. 
		It is measured in megabytes and gigabytes. </p>
		<h2 id = "ROM"> Compact Disk (CD)/Read Only Memory (ROM) Drive </h2> 
		<img src = "ROM.JPG" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the Compact Disk (CD)/Read only memory (ROM) drive" />
		<p> ROM stands for Read-Only Memory. It is an example of primary storage. The job of the CD ROM  is 
		to store data in the form of text and graphics. There are two different sectors that are defined in this
		electronic device: mode 1 and 2. Mode 1 is for storing computer data. Mode 2 is for storing
		computer audio, video, and graphic. Our headphones and speakers can be inserted on the outer 
		part of the CD ROM drive to listen to music. </p> 
		<h2 id = "Heatsink"> Heatsink </h2> 
		<img src = "Heatsink.JPG" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the heatsink" /> 
		<p> Since the CPU does a large number of tasks, it needs something to help keep it cool. The heatsink 
		does this job. The heatsink sits on top of the CPU to help get rid of the extra heat that it creates. </p>
		<h2 id = "HardDrive"> Hard Drive </h2>
		<img src = "HardDrive.JPG" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the hard drive."/>
		<p> The hard drive is where the long-term storage space for the computer is found. All files, software
		and documents saved on the computer are stored here. The faster the hard drive, the faster the 
		computer can start programs. </p> 
		<h2 id ="USBCard"> Universal Serial Bus (USB) Card </h2> 
		<img src = "USBCard.JPG" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the Universal Serial Bus (USB) card" /> 
		<p> The hard drive is where the long-term storage space for the computer is found. All files, software
		and documents saved on the computer are stored here. The faster the hard drive, the faster the computer
		can start programs. </p> 
		<h2 id = "ExpansionSlots"> Expansion Slots </h2> 
		<img src = "ExpansionSlots.jpg" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the expansions slots"> 
		<p> The expansion slots are in charge of expanding the PC. They can be used to add different 
		components such as a video card. They link between the CPU and the extra computer card expansion. 
		They are also referred to as the bus slot and expansion port. They are located on the motherboard </p> 
		<h2 id = "Case"> System Unit Case </h2> 
		<img src = "Empty.JPG" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the empty system unit case"> 
		<p> This is the system unit&apos;s case after the group removed all of its components. </p> 
		<h2 id = "End"> End Result </h2> 
		<img src = "After.JPG" height = "150" alt = "Picture of the system unit after being reassembled by the group">
		<p> This is the system unit after being successfully reassembled by the group. </p>
