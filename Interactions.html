		<h1> Interactions Between Internal Components </h1> 
		<img src = "InteractionsImage.jpg" height = "200" width= "500" alt = "Diagram showing the manner in which the input, 
		processing and internal memory, output, and storage devices interact">      
		<p> Data goes between hardware parts of a computer, allowing it to complete the processing cycle. 
		The data goes from : Input devices -> Processing / Memory devices -> Output devices. </p>
		<p> There are many different ways that these parts interact. The motherboard includes some 
		of the most important parts of the computer. Firstly, the CPU fits into the motherboard's 
		CPU socket, which is covered by the heat sink, an object that absorbs heat from the CPU. 
		The fan would then cool the area of the CPU. It also includes expansion slots, which link 
		between the CPU and the extra computer card expansion. It is located on the motherboard. 
		First, the keyboard and/or mouse provides input, which is processed by the CPU and 
		stored in the RAM for the time being. The output devices such as a printer provides some 
		output, and data is stored in storage devices such as the CD ROM and hard drive. The power 
		supply helps everything work by delivering energy to different parts of a computer. </p>
		<p> An example of when some components interact is when you open a program. When the mouse 
		(an input device) is clicked to open program, the signal is received by the CPU which sends 
		instructions to other devices on what actions to do.  A copy of the software program is 
		transferred from the hard disk (a storage device) into RAM (an internal memory device used 
		by the processing device) because what is currently required for processing by the CPU has 
		to be in the temporary storage area &minus; random access memory. When the software is transferred 
		to RAM the program is opened in response to the click of the mouse. </p>
		<p> Another example is when someone tries to edit data. The user then decides to edit the text 
		using the keyboard and/or the mouse, the CPU does the work by following the program instructions 
		given by the user ( insert a picture or use another font). The CPU sends results to monitor 
		(VDU-Visual Display Unit - VDU displaying the edited version of the file. Meanwhile, RAM 
		temporarily holds the changes you have made, so that if the user wants to go back a step they 
		will be able to so do by retrieving the version from RAM. </p>
		<p> If the user wants to save to the hard drive the user uses the mouse to click save. 
		The CPU tells RAM to send a copy of the data to the hard disk. A permanent copy is kept on 
		the hard disk. </p> 
		<h1> How a Computer Works </h1>
		<p> A computer is an information processor or in other words an electronic machine that process information. 
		It will first take raw information/ data and stores it until it needs it, processes it, then shows the results 
		on the screen. When it is taking in the input, the computer processor interacts with the primary storage, 
		referring to it for instructions and data. Then it decides to show the output after it finishes processing. 
		While executing the program, the memory is temporarily stored and then when you save anything the secondary 
		storage as it will save it permanently. The input comes from parts that are connected to your computer such as 
		your keyboard, mouse, microphone and the voice recognition. The memory/storage stores your input, files and 
		documents on your hard drive. The CD-ROM disks that you have seen with personal computers are secondary storage 
		devices, as are hard disks. For processing, your CPU (central processing unit), the brain which is a microchip 
		inside your computer processes data and sends it to different parts of your computer. Your fan and heatsink 
		prevents it from overheating.  Then the output shows on you screen, printer and loudspeakers. That&apos;s how a computer works </p>
